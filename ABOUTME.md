<!-- # About Me

Hey there, I am Utkarsh Chourasia. A full time computer science student and a computer science enthusiast.

I like to network with people, learn and teach new things. Furthermore, I am also very enthusiastic about Linux, blockchain, finance, startups, advertising, and tech in general.

If you find a guy who annoys you with Linux Ussage, that would probably me.

I believe *'Jack of all, is not bad at all'*.

Love to connect with you, my details are mentioned in ```DETAILS.md``` file of this repository. -->
