# Hello, I am Utkarsh Chourasia

Meet Utkarsh Chourasia, a highly organized and detail-oriented student who is also studying to become a software developer and is **deeply passionate** about **technology**.
Though *"technology"* would be a very broad term!

I love to **play**/**work** with

```go
[ "Terminals", "Containers", "Automation", "Backend-infra", "Cloud", "Networking" ]
```

He is a young chad who is still exploring, so that list might grow!

Utkarsh is a **modern magician**, except I transform `complicated technical ideas` into `executable code`. He is currently pursuing a *B.Tech*. in *Computer Science*.

He is an advocate for `Linux`, `Docker`, and `Go`. But he has worked with a variety of scripting languages like:

```go
[ "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "AppScript", "Python", "Bash" ]
```

There is a lot you can learn about me, and please give me the opportunity to **learn something about you**. Connect with me:
